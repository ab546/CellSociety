I worked on Daniel Rubinstein(NetID: dr148).



The first section of the code I changed is duplicate code from the SegregationGrid class. 

There were duplicated code in two methods (# of Identical neighbors and # of Total neighbors),
and I made it into one method by passing in another parameter to decide whether to return the number of identical or total neighbors.




The second section of the code I changed is make all the strings in the body of several classes constants.
